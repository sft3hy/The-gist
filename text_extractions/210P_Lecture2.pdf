Simple Linear Regression
The goal (for now) of a simple linear regression is to assess the
relationship (if any) between two quantitative variables.
Measure 2 quantitative variables on each sampled unit (e.g.
subject, school, car, etc.).
How strongly, if at all, are they related to each other?
Given a new unit not in the sample, can we predict the value
of one of the quantitative variables given the other?

Simple Linear Regression
Example: After receiving a midterm score, how well can we predict
the ﬁnal average for the course?
Data: Previous statistics class where both midterm and ﬁnal
average are observed for each student.
Let Y= Final average, be the response variable.
Let X=Midterm score, be the explanatory variable.

The equation for a linear line is: Y=0+1X.
Y is the response variable.
X is the explanatory variable.
0is the intercept. It is the value of Y when X=0.
1is the slope. It is the increases in Y when X increase by 1
unit.

Quick Algebra Review
An example of a deterministic relationship is the equation that
converts temperature from celsius (C) to fahrenheit (F) units.
The equation is: F=32+1:8C.
To convert a given celsius measurement to fahrenheit, just
plug in the celsius value in for C.
When C=0, then F=32+1.8*0=32.
When C=10, then F=32+1.8*10=50.
As C increase by 1 unit, then F increase by 1.8 units.

Quick Algebra Review
This has been an example of a deterministic relationship.
If you know X, then you can obtain the exact value of Y.
In a statistical relationship, there is variation in the possible
values of Y for each value of X.
If you know the value of X, then you can obtain an averageor
approximate value for Y.
For example, two students can have the same shoe size (X),
but have diﬀerent values for their heights (Y).
Thus, what we can do is for a given value of X, we can only
predict what Y is going to be, or obtain an average or
approximate value for Y.

Simple Linear Regression
Some more examples of statistical relationships.
The yearly income of a worker (Y) and the number of years of
education obtained (X).
The height, in inches, of a someone (Y) and the average
height of their parents (X).
How far away (in feet) can a driver read a sign (Y) and the
age of the driver (X).

Simple Linear Regression
Relating two quantitative variables.
Graph: Create a scatter plot to visually see the relationship.
Regression equation: To describe the "best" straight line
through the data, and to predict Y given a value of X.
Correlation coeﬃcient ( ): Assess the strength and direction
of the linear relationship.

Scatterplot
1. Create axis’ with the appropriate ranges for X (the
horizontal axis) and Y (the vertical axis).
2. Plot a dot for each (X,Y) pair in the data.
Scatterplot of all 73 individuals, with a line through them  
 What to notice in a scatterplot: 1. If the average  pattern is linear , 
curved, random, etc.  
2. If the trend is a positive 
association  or a negative 
association  
3. How spread out the y-values  
are at each value of x  (strength of 
relationship)  
4. Are there any outliers  – unusual 
combination of (x,y)?  
1. Average pattern looks linear  
2. It’s a positive association  (as x goes up, y goes up, on average)  
3. Student heights are quite spread out at each average parents’ height  
4. There are no obvious outliers in the combination of (x,y)  
11 / 40
Scatterplot
What to look for in the scatterplot.
1. Is the average pattern linear, curved (quadratic), random,
etc.?
2. Is the trend of the association positive or negative? In
general, does Y increase as X increases (positive), or does Y
decrease and X increases (negative).
3. How spread out are the Y-values at each value of X (the
strength of the relationship).
4. Are there any outliers? E.g. any unusual combinations of
(X,Y).
For the scatterplot in the previous slide (someone’s height plotted
against the average of their parents height), the average pattern
looks linear, the association is positive, the Y values are fairly spread
out at each value of X, and there does not seem to be any outliers.

Simple Linear Regression
The true simple linear regression equation that deﬁnes the
statistical relationship between Y and X in the population is:
Y=0+1X+"
The part0+1Xcan be viewed as the model.
0and1are unknown and will be estimated using only the
observed data.
"is the error. When these errors are not all equal to 0, then it
is not a deterministic relationship between Y and X.
For example when two people have diﬀerent heights, but have
the same average height for their parents, then "will capture
the statistical relationship aspect between X and Y.
13 / 40
Simple Linear Regression
The basic idea of the simple linear regression is to ﬁnd the best
ﬁtting line that will:
1.Estimate theaveragevalue of Y at a given value of X.
2.PredictY when X is known but the true Y is not.
Theleast squares regression line is the best straight line (linear) for
the data.
Notation of the estimated least squares regression line is:
bY=^0+^1X
where ^0and^1are the estimated values of the unknown 0and
1.
We will denote estimates with the hat notation, b.
Say A is the population parameter we are interested in. Then
bAis the estimate we obtain from the sample for the population
parameter A.

Simple Linear Regression
A regression equation describes how the mean or expectation of the
response variable relates to speciﬁc values of the predictor
variable(s).
The simple linear regression equation describes the mean of
the response variable as a straight line function of a single
predictor variable. This could be written as:
E(YjX) =0+1X
The simple linear regression population model can be written
as:
Y=0+1X+"
where"is the random error.
15 / 40
Simple Linear Regression
For individuals in the larger population from which the sample has
been taken, the simple linear population regression model can be
written as:
Yi=0+1Xi+"i
fori=1;2;:::;n.
Where nis the sample size, Yiis the response value for the i-th
observation, Xiis the covariate/predictor value for the i-th
observation, and "iis the error for the i-th observation.
And we will call the ’s (here we have 0and1) the Beta
coeﬃcients.
16 / 40
Linear Regression Equation
Continuing the example of someones height (Y) and the average
height of their parents (X).
Say the regression equation is (we will learn how to get this
equation soon enough):
^Y=16:3+0:809X:
If X=68 inches, then ^Y=16:3+0:80968=71:3 inches.
This can be interpreted as the estimate of the average height
of all people whose parents’ average height is 68 inches.
Or can be interpreted as the predicted height of someone
whose parent’s average height is 68 inches.
17 / 40
Linear Regression Equation
Continuing the example of someones height (Y) and the average
height of their parents (X). Say the regression equation is:
^Y=16:3+0:809X:
The interpretation of the intercept 16.3 is as follows. 16.3
inches is the predicted height of someone whose parents’
average height is 0.
The intercept has a meaningful interpretation when X=0 is
reasonable. In this case, X=0 is not reasonable as that would
mean the average height of the parent’s is 0 inches.
An example when X=0 is reasonable is when X is the number
of years of secondary (beyond high school) education someone
has. X=0 here means someone did not go to college, which is
reasonable.
18 / 40
Linear Regression Equation
Slope interpretation.
The interpretation of the slope 0.809 is as follows:
When the average height of the parents (X) increases by 1 unit
(that is to say increases 1 inch), we expectthe height of the
child to increase 0.809 inches.
Note: We do NOT say that as X increases that Y willincrease
by a certain amount, because that would imply a deterministic
relationship.
19 / 40
Linear Regression Equation
Directly following this interpretation, we can compute the
expected diﬀerence in heights of someone given a change in
their parents heights.
What is the expected change in height of someone whose
parents’ average height changes/increases by 10 inches?
If a single unit change in X leads to a 0.809 inch change in the
predicted Y, then a 10 unit change in X will lead to a
0.809*10=8.09 inch change in the predicted Y.
If it was a 8 inch change in X, then the predicted Y will change
by 8*0.809=6.472.

Linear Regression Equation: Residuals
The linear equation at the population level is:
Y=0+1X+"=Model+Error
Therefore we can write the following:
"=Y (0+1X)
which is to say Error=Y-Model
21 / 40
Linear Regression Equation: Residuals
At the estimated sample level:
Y=^0+^1X+e=Predicted value+Residual
Therefore: Residual= Y Predicted value
Predicted value is depicted as ^Y.
Thus: Residual= Y ^Y(e.g. Observed Y Predicted Y).
Letri(orei) denote the residual for the i-th sampling unit,
where we have a sample size of n (that is to say i=1,2,3,...,n) .
ri=Yi ^Yi, the observed value for the i-th sampling unit
minus it’s predicted value.
Note that the residuals, r’s are the empirical version of the
true errors from the population model ".
22 / 40
Linear Regression Equation: Residuals
Return to the example of someone’s height and the average height
of their parents.
Suppose someone’s parents average height is 66 inches and the
person is 69 inches tall.
Observed data is Y=69 and X=66.
^Y=16:3+0:80966=69:7. The predicted height for this
person is 69.7 inches.
Residual=69-69.7= -0.7 inches (overestimated the height by
0.7 inches).
Y=Predicted value+Residual )69=69.7+(-0.7).
Can do this for each Y observation in the dataset, and thus have n
many ri’s (for i=1,2,...,n).
23 / 40
Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation
"Fitting" of a line to the data points:
The line ^0+^1Xobtained by using the least squares method
is the best ﬁtting line through the data in the scatterplot.
What deﬁnes the "best" line is the line that minimizes the
squared diﬀerences of Y bY=Y (^0+^1X)(so what we
focus on are the squared residuals, (Y (^0+^1X))2). .
That is why the term "least squares" is used when describing
the method used to obtain the linear regression equation,
because our goal is to minimize the sum of these squared
residuals across all of our sampling units.
24 / 40
Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation
Main idea: Minimize how far oﬀ the predicted value of Y is (using the
regression equation) from the actual Y, across the observations, via what
is called an objective function .
Compute the residual for each observation in the dataset
(Residual=Y ^Yfor all Y in the data).
Thus we will have ri=Yi bYifor i=1,2,3,...,n.
The least squares regression line is the unique line that minimizes
the sum of squared residuals.
This sum is known as SSE (sum of squared errors) but is also called
SSR (sum of squared residuals).
It derives the values for ^0and^1that minimizes the following
objective function:

Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation Estimation
We need to minimize our objective function (Q) with respect to the
unknown beta coeﬃcients. That is to say we take partial
derivatives of the objective function with respect to 0and1, set
those derivatives to 0, and solve for 0and1respectively:
26 / 40
Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation Estimation
We will use the notation b0=^0andb1=^1. And we can go as
far as doing a second partial derivative test to show that the
solutions to our estimates are minimizers.

The black line depicts the residual (shown for 4 observations). The

of all these black lines across all of the data points.

Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation
For this example, SSE = 376.9 (sum of squared
errors/residuals).
Given that the dataset contained 73 observations, this means
that the average squared error per observation was 5.16.
Taking square root, on average the predicted value of Y was
oﬀ by 2.25 inches from the true Y.

Another example: A study to see if the distance at which a driver
could read a street sign at night changes with age.
Data has n=30 observations (X,Y pairs). X=age and
Y=distance in feet the sign can be read.
The scatterplot is below.
EXAMPLE 2: A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION  
x A study was done to see if the distance at which drivers 
could read a highway sign at night changes with age.

 Interpretation of slope and intercept?  
30 / 40
Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation
The estimated linear regression equation is ^Y=577 3X.
This represents a negative association (look at the sign of the
slope).
As age (X) increases by 1 year, the predicted distance the
person can read the sign decreases by 3 feet.
For someone who is 50 years old, the predicted distance they
can read the sign is 577  350=427 feet.
31 / 40
Simple Linear Regression: Regression Equation
The linear regression equation is ^Y=577 3X.
Given two people who diﬀer in age by 60 years, the predicted
diﬀerence (in feet) of the distances they can read the sign is
3*60=180 feet (the older person will be predicted to read the
sign a distance of 180 feet shorter than the younger person).
Does the intercept have a reasonable interpretation? No, since
X is age and a driver being 0 years old is not reasonable.

Can see that ﬁtting a single linear line will not ﬁt the data
points well in the previous scatter plot.
Also, the correlation coeﬃcient does not have any useful
meaning in these examples (since it measures the degree of
linear association between X and Y).
Will present a few extensions that can deal with such type of
data later on in the course.
